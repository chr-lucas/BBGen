This project was started with the intent to learn, explore, and and practice programming. The strength of the open source community lies in the collective knowledge and skill that can be shared by people with any level of experience.

This program is very simple for the time being, but it undoubtedly has room for improvement.

## How can I contribute?
### Report Bugs
Submit an issue here on Github following these guidelines:

- Be clear as to what problem you encountered.
- Explain if it is a recurring issue, or a one time problem.
- Include the operating system used to run the generator.

### Development Contribution
Please ensure that your pull request contains thorough explaination of your changes and additions.

As this is intended as a learning experience, treat your code contributions as a lesson to fellow contributors. This may be a bit of a hassle from the perspective of the project itself, but will be of great value to those following it's development.

Try to include information in commit messages that includes both ***what*** you changed and ***why*** you changed it, even if the change is obvious to you.
